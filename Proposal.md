# Paper Proposal

Develop a modular, scalable district pattern for sustainable planned communities.


## Motivation

All around the world exist planned communities, built in different centuries. A lot of them count with the same problem: The community design was not flexible enough, to support controlled growth, and once the city passed the planned borders, it grew uncontrolled. A good example for such a city is La Plata, the capital of the province Buenos Aires, built in the 19th century. The city still counts with the originally planned community in its center but outside of that grid, the city grew uncontrolled in form of medium and low density suburbs.

## Need for new communities

The world population is still growing and mega cities like Buenos Aires count with a lot of problems, because of their size and their land use patterns.
Especially in Argentina there is a need to distribute people better over the country. Almost a third of Argentinas population live in the capital.
New sustainable, easy accessible and attractive cities can support a shift to more dezentralization.


## Goals

1. Analyze existing planned communities and their growth strategies, focused on transportation and land use. Cities from different countries and centuries should be analyzed, for example: La Plata (Argentina), La Chaux-de-Fonds (Switzerland) and Abuja FCT (Nigeria)

2. Develop a modular district-pattern and guiding policies which allow the city to grow district by district. The pattern and the policies should:
* Prevent low density development
* Allow transportation to grow/scale together with the growth of the city
* Internalize externalized costs and guide inhabitants to make intelligent mode choices
* Lead to low construction costs preventing the need for expensive constructions such as tunnels, underground transportation, elevated trafic ways etc.
* Contain green zones/belts as recreational space
* Support affordable housing preventing activity concentration in only one center

3. Develop a strategy/pattern, how to integrate single-point-of-interests, like central stations, airports, riversides or ports, into a modular city and its modular transportation system.
